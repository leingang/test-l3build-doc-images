How to supply images to documents unpacked by l3build?

I have an module that I want to manage with l3build.  Unpacking a docstrip file generates a tex file.  `l3build doc` typesets that generated tex file.  But I can't figure out how to configure `build.lua` to enable that process to see any images that should be included.
